# Chargify: Sustainable EV Charging

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/konstantinjdobler/nlp-research-template?color=green)

This repository holds the code for Chargify, focused on machine learning based EV charge scheduling. This project started in the AI in Practice course together with Porsche Digital.

## Setup

### Database
We use a local MongoDB as database.

```bash
docker run --name chargify -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

Optional: Import a sample dataset to mongodb:
```bash
docker exec -i chargify /usr/bin/mongorestore --uri "mongodb://localhost:27017" --archive < api/mongodb.dump
```
With this import the database is set up to hold a test user called **chargify**, which can be used in the frontend.

### Backend API

It is recommended to run the backend in a virtual environment.

In the project root, run

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r api/requirements.txt
```

To start the backend API, move into the api directory (`cd api`) and run

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host=0.0.0.0
```

### Frontend

Move into the frontend folder

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install the required packages

```bash
npm install
```

Start the local frontend

```bash
npm start
```

### Model
This repository provides an already trained model to predict the future energy mix in the grid seven days in advance.
The default model used can be found in ```model_results/lstm```, which was trained in January 2024.
If you want to retrain the model, go through the following steps.

Follow these instructions to set up your Python environment to contribute to or run the code in this repository.
It's recommended to use [`mamba`](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) to manage dependencies. `mamba` is a drop-in replacement for `conda` re-written in C++ to speed things up significantly (you can stick with `conda` though).

<details><summary>Installing <code>mamba</code></summary>

<p>

On Unix-like platforms, run the snippet below. Otherwise, visit the [mambaforge repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge). Note this does not use the Anaconda installer, which reduces bloat.

```bash
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

</details>

#### Environment

After having installed `mamba`, you can create a `mamba` environment from the `environment.yml` with all necessary dependencies installed. Alternatively, you can use conda (the commands stay the same only replace mamba with conda). 

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

You can then activate your environment with

```bash
mamba activate aip-porsche
```

#### Updating the Environment

Working together with many people in a shared environment requires caution.
If you want to add a dependency to the `environment.yml`, install the dependency locally and test that there are no conflicts with the existing environment.
Then open a pull request with an updated `environment.yml` to ensure that all collaborators can reproduce the environment.
