# Chargify: Sustainable EV Charging

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/konstantinjdobler/nlp-research-template?color=green)

This repository holds the code for Chargify, focused on machine learning based EV charge scheduling. This project started in the AI in Practice course together with Porsche Digital.

## Setup

### Model

Follow these instructions to set up your Python environment to contribute to or run the code in this repository.
It's recommended to use [`mamba`](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) to manage dependencies. `mamba` is a drop-in replacement for `conda` re-written in C++ to speed things up significantly (you can stick with `conda` though).

<details><summary>Installing <code>mamba</code></summary>

<p>

On Unix-like platforms, run the snippet below. Otherwise, visit the [mambaforge repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge). Note this does not use the Anaconda installer, which reduces bloat.

```bash
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

</details>

#### Environment

After having installed `mamba`, you can create a `mamba` environment from the `environment.yml` with all necessary dependencies installed like this:

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

You can then activate your environment with

```bash
mamba activate aip-porsche
```

#### Updating the Environment

Working together with many people in a shared environment requires caution.
If you want to add a dependency to the `environment.yml`, install the dependency locally and test that there are no conflicts with the existing environment.
Then open a pull request with an updated `environment.yml` to ensure that all collaborators can reproduce the environment.

### Database
We use a local MongoDB as database.

```bash
docker run --name chargify -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

### Backend API

It is recommended to run the backend in a virtual environment.

In the project root, run

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r api/requirements.txt
```

To start the backend API, move into the api directory (`cd api`) and run

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host=0.0.0.0
```

### Frontend

Move into the frontend folder

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install the required packages

```bash
npm install
```

Start the local frontend

```bash
npm start
```
